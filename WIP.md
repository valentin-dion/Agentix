# Lucy, an AGI (kinda)

## Proto Agents

Our goal is to have agents coding everything, including agents.

Agents use endpoints, API, meta-prompting.

Since v1 will help to code V2, we'll code proto-agents that produce code without full grounding.

The first generation will be used to code the next

## Document everything

Since our agent will use Agentix, every moving parts should have a documentation for LLM ()

## Front, dispatcher agent
## Low code magic
## Endpoint coder
