# Agentix Framework Documentation

## Introduction

The Agentix framework is designed to streamline the development of agent-based systems, providing a robust set of tools and wrappers that facilitate the creation, management, and deployment of intelligent agents. It supports a modular architecture, allowing developers to build complex systems with reusable components.

## Wrapper Overview

Wrappers in Agentix serve as foundational building blocks, each offering specific functionalities within the framework. They include `Endpoint`, `Func`, `Event`, `MW` (Middleware), `Tool`, and `Log`. These components interact to form the backbone of Agentix applications, enabling a wide range of capabilities from event handling to API endpoint creation.

### Endpoint

Endpoints are crucial for exposing functions as web service endpoints. They allow developers to easily register functions that can be accessed via HTTP requests.

#### Usage

```python
from agentix import endpoint

@endpoint
def my_endpoint():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### Func

The `Func` wrapper is used to register and manage functions within the Agentix framework. It provides a structured way to organize logic and functionalities.

#### Example

```python
from agentix import func

@func
def my_function():
    return "Functionality encapsulated."
```

### Event

Events enable event-driven programming, allowing components to react to various triggers within the system.

#### Implementing an Event Handler

```python
from agentix import Event

@Event.on('my_event')
def handle_event(data):
    print(f"Event received: {data}")
```

### MW (Middleware)

Middleware components process requests and responses, facilitating complex workflows and data processing within agents.

#### Defining Middleware

```python
from agentix import mw

@mw
def my_middleware(ctx, conv):
    # Process conversation
    return conv
```

### Tool

Tools provide utility functions or integrations, supporting the operations of agents with external services or custom logic.

#### Creating a Tool

```python
from agentix import tool

@tool
def my_tool():
    return "Tool functionality."
```

### Log

The `Log` wrapper offers logging and debugging capabilities, essential for monitoring and troubleshooting agent behaviors.

#### Logging Example

```python
from agentix import logger

logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
```

## Integration and Interaction

These wrappers interact within the Agentix ecosystem to create a cohesive and flexible environment for developing agent-based applications. Their modular nature allows for easy customization and extension, catering to specific needs and scenarios.

## Advanced Features and Customization

Each wrapper supports advanced features and customization options, enabling developers to tailor their applications precisely. Best practices include leveraging the modular architecture for reusability and maintaining clear separation of concerns among components.

## Conclusion

The Agentix framework's wrappers provide a powerful toolkit for building agent-based systems. By understanding and utilizing these components, developers can create sophisticated applications that are both scalable and maintainable. Experimentation and exploration within the framework are encouraged to fully leverage its capabilities.
