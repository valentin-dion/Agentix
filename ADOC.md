# Endpoint Documentation

The `Endpoint` class in the Agentix framework is designed to facilitate the creation, registration, and management of API endpoints. It allows developers to easily expose functions as web service endpoints within an application.

## Overview

Endpoints in Agentix are created by defining a function and decorating it with the `@endpoint` decorator. This process registers the function as an endpoint, making it accessible via HTTP requests.

## Creating and Registering Endpoints

To create an endpoint, simply define a function that encapsulates the logic you wish to expose. Then, use the `@endpoint` decorator to register this function:

```python
from agentix import endpoint

@endpoint
def my_endpoint():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

## Integration and Routing

The integration of endpoints into the application's routing is handled externally, typically within the `cli.py` file for Flask applications. This setup allows for a separation of concerns, where `Endpoint` focuses on defining endpoints, and `cli.py` manages their integration into the web server.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how an endpoint might be integrated into a Flask application using the Agentix CLI:

```python
# This is handled in cli.py, not directly by the developer
def serve():
    from agentix import Endpoint
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    Endpoint.bootstrap(app.route)
    
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## Advanced Features

The `Endpoint` class supports several advanced features, including custom properties like `code`, `docstring`, `user_stories`, `test_cases`, and `tests`. These properties can be used to enrich the endpoint's metadata and documentation.

## Conclusion

The `Endpoint` class provides a powerful and flexible way to define and manage API endpoints in Agentix applications. By following the simple pattern of defining functions and decorating them with `@endpoint`, developers can easily expose their application logic as web services.
