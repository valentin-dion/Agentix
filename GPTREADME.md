# Agentix Framework

## Introduction
Welcome to Agentix, a cutting-edge framework designed to facilitate the development of agentic systems with minimal boilerplate. Created by Valentin, a passionate software engineer with a vision to automate senior software engineering tasks using GPT-4, Agentix represents a significant step towards achieving high-level automation and intelligence in software systems.

## Motivation
The inception of Agentix was driven by the challenges encountered in agentic behavior research and development, particularly the complexity and boilerplate associated with existing tools. Agentix aims to simplify the creation of complex agentic flows, enabling developers to focus on innovation rather than being bogged down by the intricacies of the underlying framework.

## Features
- **Low Code**: Agentix emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, allowing developers to implement complex logic with minimal code.
- **Dynamic Importing**: Seamlessly import functions, middlewares, and agents as needed, without worrying about file paths or module structures.
- **Agentic Behaviors**: From monolithic agents to swarms and trees of specialists, Agentix supports a variety of architectural patterns to suit different needs.
- **Middleware Stacks**: Agents in Agentix are composed of middleware stacks, enabling flexible and modular design.
- **Conversation Management**: With first-class support for managing conversations, Agentix facilitates smooth interactions between users and systems.
