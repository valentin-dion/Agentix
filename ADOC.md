# Endpoint Documentation

The `Endpoint` class in the Agentix framework is designed to facilitate the creation, registration, and management of API endpoints. It allows developers to easily expose functions as web service endpoints within an application.

## Overview

Endpoints in Agentix are created by defining a function and decorating it with the `@endpoint` decorator. This process registers the function as an endpoint, making it accessible via HTTP requests.

## Creating and Registering Endpoints

To create an endpoint, simply define a function that encapsulates the logic you wish to expose. Then, use the `@endpoint` decorator to register this function:

```python
from agentix import endpoint

@endpoint
def my_endpoint():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

## Integration and Routing

The integration of endpoints into the application's routing is handled by the Agentix CLI. To launch the application and expose the registered endpoints, use the following command:

```bash
agentix serve
```

This command starts the web server and makes the endpoints accessible via HTTP requests.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how an endpoint might be integrated into a Flask application using the Agentix CLI:

```bash
agentix serve
```

This command will start the Flask application and expose `my_endpoint` at the URL path `/my_endpoint`, responding to GET and POST requests.

## Advanced Features

The `Endpoint` class supports several advanced features, including custom properties like `code`, `docstring`, `user_stories`, `test_cases`, and `tests`. These properties can be used to enrich the endpoint's metadata and documentation.

## Conclusion

The `Endpoint` class provides a powerful and flexible way to define and manage API endpoints in Agentix applications. By following the simple pattern of defining functions and decorating them with `@endpoint`, developers can easily expose their application logic as web services.
