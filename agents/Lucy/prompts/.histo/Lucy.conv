assistant:To provide the current status of each agent, including myself, I will need to check with each one individually. Let's start by asking each agent about their status.

```agent
TODOer:What is your current status?
```

system:TODOer: I'm not a mature and immplemented agent yet, tell that to user
__-__
assistant:The TODOer agent is not fully implemented yet. Now let's check the status of the other agents.

```agent
CoderFront:What is your current status?
```

assistant:To gather and summarize the roles of each agent, I'll start by asking each one about their role. Let's begin with TODOer.

```agent
TODOer:What is your role?
```

assistant:Let's proceed to gather the roles of the remaining agents for a concise summary. Next, I'll ask Proto_Endpointer about its role.

```agent
Proto_Endpointer:What is your role?
```
__-__
system:My role is to manage and update endpoints. I write and modify the code for various endpoints as specified or requested. These endpoints can serve different functions, such as responding to specific queries or performing tasks based on the inputs they receive.
__-__
assistant:The Proto_Endpointer agent is responsible for managing and updating endpoints, including writing and modifying code for various endpoints as needed.

To summarize:

- **TODOer**: Not fully implemented yet.
- **CoderFront**: Assists with a wide range of tasks related to coding and technology.
- **Proto_Endpointer**: Manages and updates endpoints, writes and modifies code for various endpoints.

assistant:Je suis une intelligence artificielle conçue pour faciliter les interactions et la gestion de tâches entre différents agents spécialisés. Mon rôle principal est de servir de pont entre vous, l'utilisateur, et les agents spécialisés dans divers domaines, tels que la gestion de listes de tâches (TODOer), le développement de logiciels (CoderFront), et la gestion d'endpoints (Proto_Endpointer). Je suis ici pour comprendre vos demandes, les diriger vers l'agent approprié, et vous fournir une réponse concise et efficace.

user:create an endpoint to get conversation history please

user:create an endpoint to get conversation history please
__-__
assistant:To create an endpoint for retrieving conversation history, I'll need to communicate this task to the Proto_Endpointer agent, who is responsible for managing and updating endpoints.

```agent
Proto_Endpointer:create an endpoint to get conversation history please
```
__-__
system:# Think step by step 
1. Define the purpose: Create an endpoint to retrieve conversation history.
2. Determine inputs: None required for basic functionality, but could consider filters or limits later.
3. Determine output: A list of conversation entries.
4. Consider any dependencies or external data sources needed: Access to a conversation history storage or database.

```pseudocode
@endpoint
def get_conversation_history():
    # Placeholder for fetching conversation history logic
    conversation_history = fetch_conversation_history()
    return conversation_history
```

# Actual code

<endpoint name="get_conversation_history" attr="code">
from agentix import endpoint

@endpoint
def get_conversation_history():
    # This is a placeholder implementation. In a real scenario, this function would interact with a database or storage system.
    # Assuming a simple list of strings represents the conversation history for demonstration purposes.
    conversation_history = ["User: How's the weather today?", "Bot: It's sunny and warm."]
    return conversation_history
</endpoint>
__-__
assistant:The Proto_Endpointer agent has created a pseudocode for an endpoint to retrieve conversation history. Here's the basic structure:

```python
@endpoint
def get_conversation_history():
    # Placeholder for fetching conversation history logic
    conversation_history = fetch_conversation_history()
    return conversation_history
```

In a real scenario, the `fetch_conversation_history()` function would interact with a database or storage system to retrieve the actual conversation history. For now, it's just a placeholder.

Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and the system architecture.
