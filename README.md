# About
Hi, I'm Valentin, I ~~tinker with~~ research agentic.
My long term goal is to automate myself as a senior software engineer.
Since it has been released, I'm convinced GPT-4 is capable of that, with the right cognitive architecture.
This repository, the framework and the experiments using it I'll release over time, are my best effort towards that goalpost.
