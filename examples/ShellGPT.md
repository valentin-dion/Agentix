# ShellGPT Walkthrough

This walkthrough guides you through the process of creating a simple ShellGPT agent using Agentix. ShellGPT is designed to interpret and execute shell commands with the help of a GPT model.

## Overview

The goal of ShellGPT is to provide an intuitive interface for executing shell commands through natural language processing. This can be particularly useful for automating tasks or for users who are not familiar with shell syntax.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Agentix**: Ensure that you have Agentix installed and configured on your system.
2. **Create a new Agent**: Use the Agentix framework to create a new agent. This agent will be the core of your ShellGPT.
3. **Integrate GPT Model**: Connect your agent with a GPT model. This model will be responsible for interpreting the natural language commands and generating shell commands.
4. **Execute Commands**: Implement functionality to execute the shell commands generated by the GPT model. Ensure to handle errors and provide feedback to the user.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how a ShellGPT agent might interpret and execute a command:

**User Input**: "Create a new directory named AgentixProjects."

**GPT Model Output**: "mkdir AgentixProjects"

**Execution**: The agent executes the `mkdir AgentixProjects` command, creating a new directory.

## Conclusion

ShellGPT offers a powerful way to bridge the gap between natural language and shell commands, making it easier for users to perform tasks without needing to know specific syntax. With Agentix, creating such an agent is straightforward and requires minimal coding.
