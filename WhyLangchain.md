If we accept the statement "agents are functions".
Agents are stuff that takes an input (eg:make me a coffee). Has an output, and change a bunch of states.

Please trust me, agents are functions.

Then, they can be approached programatically. The control flow as an irreducible complexity.
If Agents are functions, agents will call each other in a way best expressed in Python (or any high level langage).

What exactly langchain offers in that context ?
