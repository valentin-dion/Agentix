# About
Hi, I'm Valentin, I ~~tinker with~~ research agentic.
My long term goal is to automate myself as a senior software engineer.
Since it has been released, I'm convinced GPT-4 is capable of that, with the right cognitive architecture.
This repository, the framework and the experiments using it (I'll release over time), are my best effort towards that goalpost.

# Agentix

Low boilerplate agentic

## Why
I've been doing stuff and drawned in complexity.
I took a pause and tried my best to design the most **Low code** and **Low boilerplate** framework to implement agentic logic.


## Theory
### Approaches to agentic
* ** Monolithic agent **

* ** Swarms **

______________

* ** Tree of specialists **

### Agents

Here we'll define what `Agent`s are in **Agentix**

From an outside/black box perspective `Agent`s are functions.

From an inside/implementation perspective `Agent`s are stacks of middlewares

#### Agents are functions



#### Agents are stacks of MWs
